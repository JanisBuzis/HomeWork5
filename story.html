            <h3>STORY</h3>
            <p>The Boys is set in a universe where superpowered individuals who are called Supes are recognized as heroes by the general public and work for a powerful corporation which is known as Vought International, which markets and monetizes them. Outside of their heroic personas, most are arrogant, selfish, and corrupt. The series primarily focuses on two groups: the Seven, Vought's premier superhero team, and the Boys, vigilantes looking to bring down Vought and its fake superheroes. 
            <p>The Boys are led by Billy Butcher, who despises all Supes, and the Seven are led by the unstable and violent Homelander. At the start of the series, the Boys are joined by Hughie Campbell after the superhero A-Train accidentally kills his girlfriend while high on drugs. Elsewhere, the Seven are joined by Annie January, a young and hopeful heroine forced to face the truth about those she admires. Other members of the Seven include the disillusioned Queen Maeve, the insecure Deep, the mysterious Black Noir, and the white supremacist Stormfront. The Boys are rounded out by tactical planner Mother's "MM" Milk, weapons specialist Frenchie, and superpowered test subject Kimiko. Overseeing the Seven is Vought executive Madelyn Stillwell, who is later succeeded by publicist Ashley Barrett, themselves overseen by Vought CEO Stan Edgar, who also maintains controlled governmental opposition via his adoptive daughter, Congresswoman Victoria Neuman.</p>
